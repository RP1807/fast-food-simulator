# fast-food-simulator
A Fast Food take away restaurant simulator in Python

This app simulates customers of a take-away restaurant, placing orders, waiting for them to be prepared and delivered to a pickup counter. After placing the order the customer waits for it to be announced before picking it up and proceeding to the dining area.

The user stories that make up this app center around four distinct roles:
 - User - the end user using the application
 - Customer - the simulated Customer
 - Order Taker - the simulated Order Taker 
 - Cook - the simulated Cook
 - Server - the simulated Server

The idea of this project was taken from [FastFood-App](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/FastFood-App.md) by changing few constraints.
This project is focused on backend application which provides simple RestAPI to trigger/start simulator with different config parameters as an input. On server, celery tasks gets triggered which executes simulator and generates log file as an output. 

## Tech Stack 
The tool requires following lib/frameworks 
 - Python (3.9.1)
 - Django (3.1.4)
 - Django Rest Framework (3.12.2)
 - Celry (5.0.5)
 - RabbitMQ 

The core functionality of this project which is simulator is implemented using Async code with `async/await`.

## How to use simulator 

1. Clone this repo 
2. Setup virtual env with Python 3.9+ 
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install necessary python packages required to run this tool.
4. Start django server locally by running `python manage.py runserver` command. 

Once server is started, open another terminal window and start celery worker by running command `celery -A fast_food_simulator worker  -l INFO`. This will start celery process which will wait for new task to recieve. Celery is used to offload simulator execution and free up server CPU for handling other requests. 

After that use any Rest client like Postman or curl to run below request 

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/run-sim/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "customer_arrival_interval": 60,
    "order_preparation_time": 5,
    "order_taker_interval": 2,
    "time_taken_by_server": 2,
    "stop_after": 300
}'
```
Server will return 201 status code as a success response and it will start simulator execution via celery task for specified amount of time. 
*Note:* All the timeouts mentioned above are in secs. 
Config params
```
customer_arrival_interval -> Simulates a customer behaviour. A new customer arrives at certain interval 
order_preparation_time -> Simulates a time taken by cook to prepare an order 
order_taker_interval -> Simulates a time taken by the order taker to take order, create unique order ticket number and place an order in kitchen.
time_taken_by_server -> Time taken by the server to serve prepared order. 
stop_after -> Execution time of a tool 
```

Sample execution logs will look like this
